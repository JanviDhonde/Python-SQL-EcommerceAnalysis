## E-commerce Data Analysis Project üìà

### Project Overview  
This project delves into a comprehensive analysis of an e-commerce dataset using Python, SQL, and visualization tools. The goal is to derive actionable insights about customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance, offering valuable guidance for data-driven business strategies.

### Objective  
The primary objectives of this project are:  
- **Identifying trends**: Uncover key patterns in customer demographics, orders, and product preferences.  
- **Evaluating performance**: Assess sales and revenue across various dimensions like product categories and regions.  
- **Providing insights**: Deliver insights to optimize operations and improve business outcomes.  

### Key Insights üåü  
- **Customer Locations**: Customers are spread across **4,119 unique cities**.  
- **Top Product Categories**: *Health and Beauty* leads with **$5.76M** in sales.  
- **Monthly Order Trends**: Peak orders were placed in **January 2018**, reflecting seasonal demand.  
- **Revenue Distribution**: The top three product categories contribute **50%** of total revenue.  
- **Payment Methods**: A remarkable **99.99%** of orders were paid via installments.  
- **Customer Retention**: No repeat purchases were observed within six months.  
- **Cumulative Sales**: A steady upward trend in cumulative monthly sales.  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Weak correlation (**-0.1**) between product price and purchase frequency.  

### Datasets  
The project analyzes seven key datasets:  
1. **customers.csv**: Customer demographics and location data.  
2. **geolocations.csv**: Latitude, longitude, and city-level mapping.  
3. **order_items.csv**: Order details, prices, and shipping information.  
4. **orders.csv**: Order timestamps and delivery timelines.  
5. **payments.csv**: Payment methods, installments, and values.  
6. **products.csv**: Product descriptions, dimensions, and categories.  
7. **sellers.csv**: Seller location and identifiers.  

### Tools and Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è  
- **Data Analysis**: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Database Management**: MySQL  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
